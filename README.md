# airflow_practice_project
This is a simple project for me to get some practice with apache airflow.

Based on the Twitter Data Pipeline Project Tutorial by Darshil Parma: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8q3OFFfY6c


Current plan:
- follow along tutorial for base functionality
- expand to allow user to put in any twitter handle
- use docker and gcs to host online
- use django as the webframework and combine with maybe some analytics
